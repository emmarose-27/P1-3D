        The US Geological Survey maintains official records of earthquake activity from around the globe. This application displays all earthquakes since 1900 with a magnitude 4.0 or greater, and updates once a day. In this visualization, small yellow
        spheres (
        <div class="small-circle"></div>
        ) are earthquakes with magnitudes between 4 and 6. Large red spheres (
        <div class="big-circle"></div>
        ) are earthquakes with a magnitude higher than 7. In between, the color and size of spheres are interpolated.
        Earthquake depth is exaggerated by a factor of 6. The pink lines (
        <div class="pink-line"></div>
        ) represent the boundaries of the tectonic plates. Earthquake data from
        <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/">USGS</a>.

        higher than 7 in chronological order. <i>Hint: May need to zoom further to see earthquakes that occurred at greater depths.</i>
